# Battleship
Created a method to determine the difficulty, and then assign the missile, gameboard size, and then assign that size into the char[][] gameboard.

Created a method to output the board.

Created a method to check the user guess. Still working on that one, so it won't be printing yet.

Created an array list to hold ships. Haven't used it yet.

Still need to create a way to position ships.
